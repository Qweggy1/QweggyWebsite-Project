    <H3 class="underline">Music Career?</H3>
</div>
<br>
<div>
    <p class="FrogInternet centertext"> When i was a tadpole i didn't actually like ANY music! Can you believe that not a single song stuck out to me. As i grew my limbs i started picking up on a lot of tunes i liked and well the dislike never came! I loved music and then it got its own little place in my tiny frog brain. I started messing around with many games and applications on both PC and Mobile for a good few years up until recently a brilliant little game came to steam called FUSER a DJ music making game where stems can be placed with other stems and it included some of todays big hits, from BLAH BLAH BLAH to KILLING IN THE NAME to LADY GAGA this is where my real music career began, i was told by many players how good i was at mixing in this game, that's where i started building an audience creating a following. Unfortunatly this game slowed down massively and it was a hard impact on me at the time. We was all in a discord group me and 130+ others we even got reconized by the main singer of OPP. Alot of us then split and the majority are still about but no where near as active. We all went seperate ways and started creating other means of music this is where i started with DAW's and DJ'in the rest is still to live today! This is where you guys are at know with me on this journey. </p>
